          <i>Biography</i><br>
          In 2015 Michigan rapper NF emerged on the scene, and just three years later he finds his latest, Perception,
          landing at the top of the Billboard 200 chart as the #1 album in the US upon release. With genuine fan-fueled
          momentum, NF is perhaps the biggest underground success story of the year.

          Since his raw and personal debut, Mansion, these fans know the score, sticking with him and growing in size.
          Mansion landed at No. 9 on Billboard’s Top Rap Albums chart and lead to his selection as Napster’s One to
          Watch, who noted, “Mansion shows us what (NF) can accomplish with a full-length album. Turns out, he can do
          quite a lot. This Michigan native specializes in vulnerable lyrics combined with a powerful energy.”

          Creating and releasing three albums in as many years, NF shows no signs of slowing down.

          With Perception, NF scored not only his first Top 10 charting release, but also his first No. 1 on
          Billboard’s
          Top 200 Chart. As Forbes noted upon Perception’s chart topping release, “NF’s success speaks to what can be
          done these days outside of the traditional system,” proving that with his strong fan base and his incredible
          drive, the success of NF’s Real Music is a true testament to his status as an emerging talent in the hip hop
          world.
